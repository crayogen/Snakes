# Snakes
Online multiplayer Snakes game

This contains code for both the server and the client. The game will have a single server and multiple clients/players. The game ends when there is only one player left, in which case the last player left is the winner. Collision with the sides or with other snakes kills the snake; if there is a head-on collisions between two snakes, then both snakes die. Eating food makes the snake longer and gives the player points. <br/>
Each client/player has a scoreboard with his/her kill-count i.e (number of snakes that collided with said player's snake) and food-count.
